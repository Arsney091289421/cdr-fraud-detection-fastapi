## CDR Fraud Detection with FastAPI

### Overview
This project is a complete deployment-ready **CDR (Call Detail Record) Fraud Detection** web application.
It utilizes a pre-trained Random Forest model to predict potential telecom fraud based on user input.

The project includes:
- A RESTful API built with **FastAPI**
- An interactive and responsive web UI
- Docker containerization for easy deployment
- Deployable on **Render** with auto-deploy support

---

### Features
- `/predict` endpoint for fraud detection predictions
- `/health` endpoint for status checking
- `/ui` endpoint for an intuitive web interface
- Fraud threshold adjustable via API
- Fully dockerized and tested deployment
